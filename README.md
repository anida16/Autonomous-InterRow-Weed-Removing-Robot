# Autonomous-InterRow-Weed-Removing-Robot
Partially Sponsored by Agnel Robotics Club (ARC)

Final Year Project for BE Mechanical Degree.
YOLOv4 weights and video too big for github so not uploaded.

Primary purpose of this is just to have backup just in case my jetson memory card gets corrupted.
Will make proper documentation and file arrangement after project completion.
