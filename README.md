# Autonomous-InterRow-Weed-Removing-Robot

## Project Partially Sponsored by Agnel Robotics Club (ARC)

#### Hello, I am Anish Dalvi from Mechanical Batch of 2021 from Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India and this is my Final year Project.

It is a Weeding Robot for Agricultural Farm field of any terrain powered by 6 planetary geared motors controlled by NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB. Robot design is based on Rocker-Bogie Mechanism which is used by NASA/JPL for it's Interplanetary rovers. For Autonomous Navigation it uses OpenCV's Hough Transform for Lane Detection and Deep learning model tiny-YOLOv4 for Crop detection.
